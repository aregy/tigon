# Tour of a decently simple init config

Note. I exclusively use Emacs outside of the console. No real reason for that, but there are better terminal text editors (neovim being the main one)
Note II. I don't use Emacs-client because I haven't had a need for it lately.
Note III. I don't really know how to use org-mode :)

** Strongly held personal preferences:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle config.el
(menu-bar-showhide-tool-bar-menu-customize-disable)
(menu-bar--visual-line-mode-enable) 
#+end_src

** Correcting for issue-of-the-day in my OS lineup
*** NOTE: Darwin somehow has not manifested this Linux issue I encounter when mistyping C-z while using WSL Emacs
#+begin_src elisp :tangle config.el

** Everything else

As you can tell, I'm keeping it pretty minimal:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle config.el
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (defun ay/pkg-load (pkg)
    (interactive)
    (unless (package-install pkg)
      (package-refresh-contents)
       (package-installed-p pkg)
       (message ":::%s installed:::" pkg))
     (require pkg))

  (ay/pkg-load 'geiser)
  (ay/pkg-load 'geiser-racket)
  (ay/pkg-load 'csharp-mode)
  (ay/pkg-load 'powershell)
  (ay/pkg-load 'ob-powershell)
#+end_src
