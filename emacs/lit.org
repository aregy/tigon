#+TITLE: Changing the model for incremental improvement
#+DATE: <2025-02-09 Sun>

** Atomic Habits and its model
By now, everyone is well aware of the model presented by James Clear in Atomic Habits of compounded improvemnt with repeat iterations. Rinse, repeat, you can git gud with any atomic habit.

** Introducing the Jenga model
Try Clear's strategy and things start feeling like a definition problem of defining a sufficiently small habit that remain meaningful while being doable. The atomic habit model is normative but the Jenga model is positive for the general case of what a practitioner of Clear's strategy will actually feel for a not-completely understood task.

Ultimately, Clear's strategy remains valuable but the Jenga model puts to words the very next problem space to be tackled.

# Typical workflows

- git fetch origin
- =git status --short --branch= or =git status -sb=
- git pull origin
  - note: this pulls the current branch but you can execute =git pull origin main=
- ... make changes
- =git push -u origin main=

#  Git subcommands

* restore
